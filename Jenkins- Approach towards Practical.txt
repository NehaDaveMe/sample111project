1.		Create Jenkin's server (ec2 t2.micro) and install Jenkins on it. Connect to that server (don't forget to change ip in manage jenkins->system>jenkin url)
2.	Install Plugins
				
				First time user go Dashboard->ManageJenkins->Plugins
																													install required plugins to configure many 3rd party tools like(maven,git,sonar etc) in Jenkins->Tool 
3.	Create Pipeline	Job
				Give required GIT repo details.
				Here it will be all GIT only.
				my slang :: it is front end ui based piepline will be created but actual piepline we will create in backend through code which is itself
									  Jenkins file (pipeline syntax code) i.e Declarative approach
				
4.	Start writing Jenkinsfile
				
				CI part
				
				1. SCM checkout
						take pipeline syntax from google
						part inside steps changes as per requirement so everytime generate it from snippett generator in Jenkins 
						e.x. here git		
				2. Validate the code
						set 3 executable paths Maven ,GIT,JDK  (Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Tools)
						get the code
				3. Compile the code
						Compile = validate+compile
				4. Unit test framework implementation
				5. Create package
					check  .war(package) file should be available
					
				CD part	
				
				1. create Deployment server and install Tomcat(.war package needs something to run on it,Tomcat is engine without this deployment server is nothing)
				on it
				2. Handshake
						Jenkin server and newly created deployment tomcat server
				3. write code in Jenkins file for deployment		
5. Check Browser
http://<tomcat public IP>:8080/webapp
